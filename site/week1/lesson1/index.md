## Terminals

### What is a terminal?

A terminal is a way to interact with your computer. But instead of a mouse and buttons to click, you type in commands.
One example of a command you can run is `python yourcode.py` which will run your python code (assuming you have a file called `yourcode.py`).
The terminal is also called a command line or a shell.
For the first part of this class, we will be using the terminal to interact with, and test, our code.

### What does a terminal look like?

![Terminal](./terminal.png "Windows Terminal")
Here is a basic terminal on Windows. For this class we will use an online terminal called [repl.it](https://repl.it). This lets us run code without having to install anything on our computer. It also lets us share our code with other people easily.
Later in this class we will learn about different types of terminals and how to use them. But for now, let's start with repl.it.

## Repl.it

### What is repl.it?

repl.it is an online terminal. It lets us run code without having to install anything on our computer. It also lets us share our code with other people easily.
Repl.it let's us use many different languages. For this class we will be using Python.

### How do I use repl.it?

Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it) and click on
![StartButton](./startbutton.png)
Now you need to create an account.
Once you have an account, go to [Replit Home](https://replit.com/~) and click on
![NewRepl](./newrepl.png)
In the top left corner. Now select the Python template. Then name your project and click create repl.

### What is this?

You should see a pretty empty screen. On the left is the file explorer. This is where you can see all the files in your project. In the middle is the code editor. This is where you can write your code. On the right is the terminal. This is where you can run your code. You can also use the terminal to run other commands.

## Python

Now let's put that code editor to use. In the code editor, type in the following code:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Now click the run button in the top middle of the screen. You should see the terminal print out `Hello World!`. Congratulations! You just ran your first python program.

### What is Python?

Python is a programming language. It is a way to tell the computer what to do.
In the above example we told the computer to `print` the words `Hello World!`. The `print` command is a built in command in python. It tells the computer to print out whatever is inside the parentheses. When we want to represent words/text in python, we put them inside quotes. When we want to represent numbers in python, we don't put them inside quotes.
In the next lesson we will learn more about python and how to use it.
