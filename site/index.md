# Table of Contents

There is 3 types of pages in this site:
 - Lessons: These are not required, because they are covered in class. But if you missed a class, need help, or want to review, you can read these.
 - Homework: These are required. They are due before the next lesson. If you are unable to complete the homework, please contact me. I will be happy to help you.
 - Projects: These are self-guided projects. You will solve a problem/project that you choose.
